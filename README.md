Skull and Bones is a 2024 action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Singapore and published by Ubisoft. The game revolves around piracy and naval warfare with a fantastical setting in East Africa and Southeast Asia during the late 17th century, the peak of the Golden Age of Piracy. It was released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on February 16, 2024, after multiple delays and developmental difficulties, to mixed reviews.

## Project Objective 
- To understand player's emotions about the Skull And Bone game using Sentiment Analysis from Text Mining

## Project Constraint

## Data : 
We have scrapped data from an open-source platform (here Google Reviews) for sentiment analysis. It contains reviews by players and names of players.
